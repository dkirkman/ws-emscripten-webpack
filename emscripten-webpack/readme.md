# ws-emscripten-webpack

This is boilerplate that demonstrates making emscripten, cmake, webpack
and node.js work together.

The main makefile will produces node usable code in <tt>build</tt>.
`npm run build` will produce a bundle in <tt>dist</tt> for the
code in <tt>build</tt>.

A more detailed discussion and live examples of the bundle usage is
on my [blog](https://wildsilicon.com/blog/2018/emscripten-webpack/)
